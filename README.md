# Nauth
An authentication method for Android devices that is based on the compass.  
  
Mobile authentication that uses the touchscreen as an input such as pattern, PIN or password is vulnerable to attacks that take advantage of residues left on the touchscreen like smudge or heat traces. Authentication can be done using biometrics such as face and finger but not all phones have it. In comparison, there are more phones that have a compass. Nauth, an Android application, demonstrates the use of directions through the compass as an input for an alternative authentication method.
